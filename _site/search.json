    "section": "Our Story",
    "text": "Our Story\nInspireHer started with a simple idea: to inspire the next generation of female leaders in STEM. It began with Sruthi’s passion for these fields and the recognition at her first engineering class, where she was 1 of 4 girls in the whole class. She wanted to create a supportive community where girls could be inspired, and they could connect, learn, and grow. Since its founding in December 2024, InspireHer has been dedicated to fostering a love for STEM among young girls."
